andes_gym
=========

Andes environment for OpenAI Gym

* Free software: GPL v3+
 
Installation
------------

Create an empty conda environment with

```
git clone https://github.com/cuihantao/andes_gym
```


Clone the repository with

```
conda create -n andes_gym --yes
```

Install the previous version of ANDES with 

```
pip install andes==0.6.9
```

Install `mpi4py` from Intel with

```
conda install -c intel mpi4py
```

In the root directory of `andes_gym`, install `andes_gym` in the development mode with

```
pip install -e .
```

Examples
--------
Try out examples in the folder `examples`.

Edit the number of time steps in `train_freq_ddpg.py` to a proper value. The larger the value, the longer it takes to simulate and train.

Run the example with 

```
python train_freq_ddpg.py
```
Some deprecation warnings can be safely ignored.

When the training is completed, replay the trained model with 

```
python play_freq_ddpg.py
```

You may need to install additional packages, such as matplotlib, to show the visualization.
The matplotlib window might appear frozen, but is actually refreshed after each run.


Performance Tips
----------------

While most of the computation time was spent in ANDES, tests show that Linux perform consistently better than Windows, especially with `cvxoptklu` installed.

Currently, it is difficult to install `cvxoptklu` on Windows. Therefore, a Linux box is recommended whenever possible.

Some algorithms can take advantage of multi-core processors but most cannot. Please check the algorithm documentation from stable-baselines to verify. A quick way to check if an algorithm is taking advantage of your multi-core processor is to check the utilization of CPU (in Windows Task Manager or in `htop` of Linux).

Version Control
---------------

When working on the source code, please branch from `master` and work on your own branch.

You can either use GitHub for Desktop or learn the commands. The following are some commands for quick reference.


Branching can be done the collowing command

```
git checkout -b YOUR_BRANCH_NAME
```
where `YOUR_BRANCH_NAME` is the branch name of your choice.

To stage changes, use

```
git add PATH_TO_FILE
```

To commit changes, use

```
git commit 
```

To push to a not-yet-exising branch, use

```
git push -u origin YOUR_BRANCH_NAME
```

After the first push, your local git will memorize the tracking branch. Next time, you can simply push with

```
git push
```
